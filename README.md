# PCBS_Synesthesia

The purpose of this experiment is to test numerical synesthesia (which is a subphenomenon of synesthesia (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesth%C3%A9sie)).

When a non-synesthetic person looks at a grid filled with "5" among which there is a "2", it is difficult for him to identify it quickly.
However, for a person that have numerical synesthesia, the "2" can stand out much more clearly.

I would like to try to program an experiment measuring the response time (time it takes a subject to see the "2" of all the "5") for various panels.

If I can do it quickly enough I could try to program the apparition of the different panels in a random way or even to make the position of the numbers of each panel random.

Planning :

01/04 : V : Project creation
06/04 : V : Fixation Cross
08/04 : V : Stimulus apparition after a certain time + Press space bar to go on the next trial + RT measurement (list + mean + std)
15/04 : X : Random pannels creation
22/04 : X : Add an introduction pannel with instructions (+ add the posibility to enter the name of the participant in order to save data ?)
29/04 : X : Set the definitive parameter of the experiement and make code adjustement for efficiency and intelligibility
